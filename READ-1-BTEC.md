# API

An interface is a set of protocols and tools for building
applications and programs, an API is an interface that consists
of functions and these functions enable programmers to access
data for an application or an operating system. It is a web
application programming interface that can be accessed using the
HTTP protocol and can be built by using java and net …
A middleware that allows two applications to communicate and
exchange data with each other, according to a set of predefined
conditions and protocols. An API gives companies the ability to
provide their application data and functionality to third-party
developers, business partners, or internal divisions within the
same company, and allows services and products to communicate
with each other and mutually benefit from the data. App
developers can also use it without knowing how it works; This
simplifies the application development process and saves time
and money.

## type of API

1- A type that depends on the programming language, meaning that a group of commands and functions are compiled in the same language in a specific code, and all of them fall under a fixed name or structure that can be used by simply writing a code sentence without the need to pay attention to the internal commands and functions.

2- A type independent of the programming language that does not need to be written in the form of a specific programming language, but rather written in a way that you can understand most programming languages. We know that all programming languages ​​are translated in the end into the assembly language (ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE)
It is from this principle that this type of API is designed in the assembly language
This type is used in WEB SERVICES that allow more than one system to communicate with each other regardless of the programming language used.

+ Public APIs
+ Partner APIs
+ Internal APIs

+ Composite APIs

Advantages

1. An API that allows developers to communicate and communicate by using a protocol: This protocol allows the communication of both integrated and discrete programs where the interface is the medium through which the two systems can communicate.

2. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are essential to communication and are everywhere such as: Twitter API, Flickr API and Maps API.

3. Controlling access to resources via (API): The API also uses APIs to control access to hardware and software functions that an application may not necessarily have permission to use.

4. Makes developers work easier

5. Safety: The use of sites and APIs supports security levels. When you send a request, you are not connected directly to the server. It sends a small amount of information, the API delivers it, and then the server sends it back. This reduces the risk of a breach or someone gaining access to the server's backend.

## API and  SDK

SDK: It is a selected set of software used for specific purposes such as developing an application for a specific device or a specific operating program.
Software development kits usually contain an integrated development environment (IDE) that serves as the central programming interface. This environment can contain a window for writing the source code, as well as a debugger that performs the debugging process. The kit contains a visual editor, which allows developers to create and modify the program's graphical user interface, which is technically known as (GUI). It also contains the compiler, which builds applications from the source code.

## differences between API and SDK

The SDK is equivalent to the development integration tool environment, and the API is the data interface. Calling the API data in the SDK environment.
In fact, the SDK includes the definition of an application programming interface (API), which defines the capability and specification of an interface, and the SDK can include this capability and that specification. However, the SDK does not fully contain only an API and API, it is a software toolkit and has many other add-ons.
The SDK contains the information needed to use the API, so people often call the development method for writing Windows applications using the API only as "SDK Programming".

### API

The channel through which the front end calls the back-end data is what we call an interface. Through this channel, the back-end data can be accessed without calling the source code.

### SDK

Engineers help develop a set of documents, examples, and tools relevant to specific types of software. Using the SDK can improve development efficiency and facilitate access to certain functions
